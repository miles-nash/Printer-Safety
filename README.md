# Printer-Safety
A gadget that allows for the monitoring of air quality within a room and responds accordingly with safety procedures.

The goal of this project is to detect, alert, and reduce the damage of any fires. Detetect particulate matter that could cause lung damage

For a full tutorial visit my hackster.io page.

Ideal functionality:

Detection of particualate matter i.e smoke, Saw dust, any material harmfull to lungs.

Alarm- A loud obnoctious alarm to ensure anyone in the house knows that a problem has arrisen.

Text alert functionality- When the sensor detects a hazard, an SMS alert will be sent to the users phone warning them of the situation even if they are away from home.

Power kill on alarm- When a hazard is detected, power to electronics (3d printer, Soldering iron, other electronic tools) is cut. This may minimize the damage or even stop electrical fire related hazards.

Snoozable- Hit button to disarm the sensor for a period of time. Useful for when smoke is expected or the source of the smoke has been taken care of. Sensor will re-arm after a designated period.
